## Attributions, Licensing, Acknowledgements

Note that this is a living document. Completeness is not guaranteed. If no author is listed, the intent is to spread attribution across a larger organisation.

If you're aware of any attribution which is evidently missing from this list, or of a misattribution, let me know so I can resolve it.
